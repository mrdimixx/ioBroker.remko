## REMKO heat pump adapter for ioBroker

Reads and controls **REMKO heat pumps with Smart-Web / Smart-Control** (firmware 4.26 and newer) locally via MQTT. No cloud and no additional MQTT broker needed.

Tested with: REMKO WKF 100, Smart-Web firmware 4.28. Feedback on other models (WKF, WSP, LWM, KWT …) is very welcome – please open an issue.

Manufacturer: [REMKO GmbH & Co. KG](https://www.remko.de)

## How it works

The Smart-Control runs its own MQTT broker (WebSocket port 9001, which is also used by the web UI, and TCP port 1883).
On startup the adapter reads everything it needs **directly from the web UI of the heat pump**:

| Source | Content |
|---|---|
| `/js/smt.min.js` | firmware version → topic (e.g. `V04P28/SMTID`), MQTT credentials |
| `/json/smt18.json` + `/json/smtmain.json` | complete register database (~2,150 registers): type, range, decimals, unit, texts, menu tree, display conditions |

No register is hard-coded – other models and firmware versions bring their own definitions.

Protocol:

- read: `CLIENT2HOST` ← `{"FORCE_RESPONSE":true,"query_list":[1082,5039,…],"CLIENT_ID":"SMT123I0000000000000000"}`
- answer: `HOST2CLIENT` → `{"values":{"1082":"01C2","5039":"01DC",…}}` (big-endian hex, scaled according to the register database)
- write: the same request with `"values":{"1082":"01E0"}`

## Configuration

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| IP address | IP address of the Smart-Web / Smart-Control |
| Transport / port | WebSocket 9001 (default, like the web UI) or MQTT TCP 1883 |
| MQTT password / topic | leave empty – read automatically from the web UI |
| Fast query / full refresh | interval of the fast query (overview values) and of the full refresh of all registers |
| Which data points | like the web UI (user, status, overview) or additionally service / expert / commissioning |
| Writable registers | off, user menu (recommended) or all parameters (expert) |

## Objects

The adapter evaluates the **display conditions of the web UI** (e.g. "solar only if a solar system is enabled"), so only data points that exist on your installation are created. The structure follows the menu of the controller:

- `remko.0.information.<area>.<no>` – user → information (e.g. `information.warmwasser.5039`)
- `remko.0.einstellungen.<area>.<no>` – user → settings (e.g. `einstellungen.warmwasser.1082`)
- `remko.0.status.<no>` – status page
- `remko.0.uebersicht…`, `remko.0.homescreen…` – basic display
- optional `service…`, `experte…`, `inbetriebnahme…`

The register number is always the last part of the id. Names, units, min/max and enumerations (`common.states`) come from the heat pump (German texts, as delivered by the controller).

Important registers (WKF 100):

| No | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 1079 | DHW mode (0 comfort, 1 eco, 2 solar/PV only, 3 off) |
| 1082 | DHW setpoint |
| 1951 / 1088 | room climate mode |
| 1893 / 1894 | absence / party |
| 1946 | colder / warmer |
| 5693 | 1x DHW heating (button) |
| 1269 / 1270 | DHW setpoint SG-Ready state 3 / 4 |
| 1902 / 1258 | heating setpoint SG-Ready state 3 / 4 |
| 2142, 1719–1722, 1679, 2164 | PV self-consumption / influence |
| 5001 | current operating mode |
| 5032 / 5039 / 5132 / 5581 | outdoor / DHW actual / flow / return temperature |
| 5320 / 5321 | electrical / thermal power |
| 5105 / 5119 | electrical / thermal energy |
| 5359 / 5565 | PV power / PV yield (from the heat pump's meter input) |
| 5174 / 5572 | utility lock / remaining lock time |

### Write protection

- **Off**: read only
- **User menu** (default): only registers that can also be changed in the user menu of the controller. Network, password and installation registers are always locked. Actions: only "1x DHW heating" and "reset fault".
- **All parameters**: expert mode – also service/installation values and critical actions (update, restart, reset). Use with care!

Values outside the allowed range are rejected by the adapter.

## Test without installation

```
node tools/probe.js <ip-of-heat-pump>                  # read only
node tools/probe.js <ip-of-heat-pump> --write 1082=46  # write one value
```
